# Sea Level Rise Visualization

This project analyzes and visualizes the rise in sea level over time using data from the EPA. It uses Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib to create a scatter plot of observed sea level data and two lines of best fit: one for the entire dataset (1880–2050) and one for recent data (2000–2050).

## **Project Description**
The dataset contains historical sea level measurements and predictions. The goal of this project is to:
1. Visualize the observed sea level data.
2. Predict future sea level rise using linear regression.
3. Compare predictions based on the entire dataset vs. recent data.

## **Files in the Project**
- `epa-sea-level.csv`: The dataset containing sea level measurements.
- `sea_level_plot.png`: The output plot showing the scatter plot and lines of best fit.
- `sea_level_visualizer.py`: The Python script used to generate the plot.
